## Introducting new CORE
We’re creating a better way for you to submit CORE data; built from the ground up with the user in mind. We’re looking for forward-looking organisations to perfect our new service. 

New CORE is ready to accept your data for 2021/22. Here are a few of the reasons why you might want to start using new CORE today.

## A service for everybody
Our new service is accessible to all - however you use it - whether that’s on paper, mobile, tablet or using a screen reader and other assistive technology.

You told us the questions are complicated and difficult to understand. By splitting the form into logical sections and using one question per page, we’ve made the content clear and easy to digest.

## You spoke, we listened
We’ve taken some of your biggest pain points from current CORE and created solutions to make submitting data simpler. 

For example, you told us that current CORE often rejects postcodes. Now, we accept any postcode, even ones for new build properties.

We’ve also relaxed the rules around rent ranges — and made it easier for you to catch any mistakes.

## We’re enabling new workflows
It’s not just the CORE website we’ve redesigned; the paper form is all new. Of course, the new paper form exactly mirrors the CORE website, so rekeying your data is easy.

What’s more, we’ve now split the form by section - so you  only need to take the questions you want to ask tenants on visits. Really useful when you can part-fill the log using data from your HMS.

Or, if you prefer, leave paper behind and fill CORE from anywhere on your mobile device or tablet.
