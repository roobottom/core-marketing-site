title: What happens after signing up to the private beta for new CORE?
---
Thank you for choosing to take part in the private beta for ‘Submit social housing lettings and sales (CORE)’.

As a private beta user, you’ll be using an early version of the service and giving us feedback on what’s working and what’s not.

We want to make switching over to the new system as easy as possible, with a few simple steps.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1</h2>

Within 2 weeks of you signing up, we’ll email you with an approximate timeframe for when your organisation can start using the new service.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2</h2>

2 weeks before we’re ready to move all your organisation’s data (logs, users, organisation details and data sharing agreement) over to the new service, we’ll send you an email asking you to:

* correct or complete any logs you've created on the existing CORE system
* tell us about any inactive accounts
* tell us about any shared accounts

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3</h2>

We’ll send you another email 48 hours before we intend to move your data and disable your organisation’s access to the existing CORE system.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 4</h2>

We’ll move your data across to the new service. We’ll try and do this out of hours, if we can’t there might be a couple of hours during which you will need to pause any work relating to CORE.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 5</h2>

As soon as your organisation’s data is successfully migrated, we’ll send you and all active users in your organisation an email with a link to new CORE. You’ll then be able to set up a new password and start creating logs or uploading data in the new service.

Next time you log in to the new service, you’ll use your email address instead of a username.

You can [contact the helpdesk](https://digital.dclg.gov.uk/jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/create/89) with any questions.
